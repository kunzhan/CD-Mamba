# CD-Mamba: Cloud Detection with Long-Range Spatial Dependency Modeling

Remote sensing images are frequently obscured by cloud cover, posing significant challenges to data integrity and reliability. Effective cloud detection requires addressing both short-range spatial redundancies and long-range atmospheric similarities among cloud patches. Convolutional neural networks are effective at capturing local spatial dependencies, while Mamba has strong capabilities in modeling long-range dependencies. To fully leverage both local spatial relations and long-range dependencies, we propose CD-Mamba, a hybrid model that integrates convolution and Mambaâ€™s state-space modeling into a unified cloud detection network. CD-Mamba is designed to comprehensively capture pixel-wise textural details and long-term patch-wise dependencies for cloud detection. This design enables CD-Mamba to manage both pixel-wise interactions and extensive patch-wise dependencies simultaneously, improving detection accuracy across diverse spatial scales. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of CD-Mamba and demonstrate its superior performance over existing methods.
